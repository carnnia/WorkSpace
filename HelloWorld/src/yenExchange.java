Scope:    Currency conversion. Write a program that first asks the user to type today's
            price for one dollar in Japanese yen, then reads U.S. dollar values and converts
            each to yen. Use 0 as a sentinel.
Solution: 	welcome the user
			ask the user to make a decision [1 = sell , 2 = buy , 0 = Exit ]
			if 1
				get sell value of one yen in dollars yenSellValue double
				get transaction amount
			if 2 
				get buy value of one yen in dollars yenBuyValue double
			if 3
				exit
