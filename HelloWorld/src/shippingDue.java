Name:		Casey Carnnia
Date: 		10.10.2012
Scope:		Write an if-else statement to compute the amount of shipping due on an online sale. 
			If the cost of the purchase is less than $20, the shipping cost is $5.99.  
			If the cost of the purchase over $20 and  at most $65, the shipping cost is $10.99.  
			If the cost of the purchase is over $65, the shipping cost is $15.99.

Solution: 	Import Scanner class from java.util package
			Welcome the user
			prompt for INPUT_PRICE type = double
			store the input in constants INPUT_PRICE values will not change
			declare a variable shipping type = double
			if INPUT_PRICE < 20
				shipping = 5.99
			else if INPUT_PRICE > 20 AND INPUT_PRICE <= 65
				shipping = 10.99
			else if INPUT_PRICE > 65
				shipping = 15.99 
			 
			output: "Cost of shipping is $ shipping"
