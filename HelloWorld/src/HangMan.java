Scope: Problem 2:
Consider a class that could be used to play a game of hangman. The class has the following attributes:
    The secret word
    The disguised word, in which each unknown letter in the secret word is replaced with a question mark (?). For example, if the secret word is abracadabra, and the letters a , and b have been guessed, the disguised word would be ab?a?a?ab?a
    The number of guesses made
    The number of incorrect guesses
It will have the following methods:
    MakeGuess(c) guesses that character c is in the word
    getDisguisedWord returns a string containing correctly guessed letters in their correct positions 
    and unknown letters replaced with ?
    getSecretWord returns the secret word
    getGuessCount returns the number of guesses made
    isFound returns true if the hidden word has been discovered.
Perform the following actions:
    Write a method heading for each method.
    Write preconditions and postconditions for each method.
    Write some Java statements that test the class.
    Implement the class.
    List any additional methods and attributes needed in the implementation that were not listed 
    in the original design. List any other changes made to the original design.
    Write a program that implements the game of hangman, using the class you wrote for part d.
