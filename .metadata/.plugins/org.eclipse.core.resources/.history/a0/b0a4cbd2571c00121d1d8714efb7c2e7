Scope:		Problem 1: Write a program that reads a set of floating-point values. Ask the user to enter the values, then print:
		    The average of the values
		    The smallest of the values
		    The largest of the values
		    The range, that is the difference between the smallest and the largest Of course, you may only prompt for the values once.


Solution: 	prompt the user for input. 
 			**Important**
 				the problem says a set of numbers so we don't need to program for a variable set. we can say a set of 5, or 10.
			read the user inputs in a loop

		// get ready to read the user data
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		// prompt the user for input
		// store the user input
