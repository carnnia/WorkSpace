Scope:    Suppose your cell phone carrier charges you $29.95 for up to 300 minutes of calls, 
		  and $0.45 for each additional minute, plus 12.5 percent taxes and fees.
		  Give an algorithm to compute the monthly charge from a given number of minutes.
Solution: 	welcome the user
			set constant basicPrice = 29.95 type = float
			set constant planMinutes = 300 type = int
			set constant extraMinutesFee = 0.45 type = float
			set constant taxFees = 12.5 / 100 type = double
			ask the user to input numberOfMinutes type = int
			set variable totalCost type = double 
			total cost = ( basicPrice + ( (numberOfMinutes - planMinutes) . extraMinutesFee )) . taxFees
			out put the detail report
			 
			
			if 1
				get sell value of one yen in dollars yenSellValue = double
				get   transactionAmount type = double 
				multiply transaction amount by selling value of yen
				print out the answer  
			if 2 
				get buy value of one yen in dollars yenBuyValue double
				get  transactionAmount type = double 
				multiply transaction amount by yenBuyValue value of yen
				print out the answer
			if 3
				exit
