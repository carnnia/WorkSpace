Scope:		Problem 3: The Fibonacci numbers are defined by the sequence:
		    f1 = 1
		    f2 = 1
		    fn = fn-1 + fn-2.
			Reformulate that as 
			    Fold1 = 1;
			    Fold2=1;
			    Fnew=fold1+fold2;
			After that, discard fold2, which is no longer needed, and set fold2 to fold1, and fold1 to fnew. Repeat an appropriate number of times.
			Implement a program that prompts the user for an integer n and prints the nth Fibonacci number, using the above algorithm.


Solution: 	welcome the user
			instantiate a variable userInput = "" type = int
			prompt the user for input
			store the user input in userInput
			using a loop 	
 				instantiate a counter
 				as long as the counter is less then the length of userInput
 				output using println() this index of userInput
