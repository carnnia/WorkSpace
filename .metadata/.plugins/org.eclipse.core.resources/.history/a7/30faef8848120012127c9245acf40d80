Scope:    Suppose your cell phone carrier charges you $29.95 for up to 300 minutes of calls, 
		  and $0.45 for each additional minute, plus 12.5 percent taxes and fees.
		  Give an algorithm to compute the monthly charge from a given number of minutes.
Solution: 	welcome the user
			set constant BASIC_PRICE = 29.95 type = double
			set constant PLAN_MINUTES = 300 type = int
			set constant EXTRA_MINUTES_FEE = 0.45 type = double
			set constant TAX_FEES = 12.5 / 100 type = double
			set variable cost and totalCost type = double
			ask the user to input numberOfMinutes type = int 
			cost =  BASIC_PRICE + ( (numberOfMinutes - PLAN_MINUTES) * EXTRA_MINUTES_FEE )
			totalCost = cost + (cost  * TAX_FEES)
			out put the detail report
